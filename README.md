# Making A Game In Every Language

**Making A Game In Every Language**—yes, you heard that right! This is a long‑awaited series and a dream of mine: to build a playable game in every mainstream programming language, even if it’s just a simple Flappy Bird clone or a Mario‑style platformer.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Learn & Explore**: Dive into different language ecosystems, understand their game‑dev libraries, and explore unique paradigms.
2. **Build – Fast!**: Ship a minimal viable game (MVP)—from mechanics to basic graphics—in each language.
3. **Share Knowledge**: Document the process, challenges, and solutions in clear READMEs and blog posts.
4. **Community Collaboration**: Invite contributions, feedback, and improvements to each implementation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/GameEveryLanguage.git
   cd GameEveryLanguage
   ```

2. **Pick Your Language Folder**
   Each subfolder is named after the language (e.g. `CSharp-Unity`, `Python-Pygame`).

3. **Read the Language‑Specific README**
   Inside each folder, you’ll find setup instructions, dependencies, and build/run commands.

4. **Run & Play**
   Follow the quickstart: launch the game, test controls, and explore the code.

5. **Learn & Tinker**
   Experiment with features, graphics, or add new mechanics. Submit your pull requests!
